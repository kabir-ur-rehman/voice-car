# voice-car
This project is an IoT-based smart car controlled using both mobile app buttons (Blynk IoT) and real-time voice commands. The car uses an ESP32 for WiFi connectivity, a motor driver for movement, and Python speech recognition to convert voice commands into actions via the Blynk Cloud API.  🔑 Key Features  Control car using Blynk IoT mobile app  Voice control via Python (forward, backward, left, right, stop, donut, horn)  WiFi-based control using ESP32  Real-time response with cloud integration  Audio feedback using speaker (MAX98357A)  🛠 Technologies Used  ESP32  Blynk IoT Platform  Python (Speech Recognition)  Arduino IDE  IoT & Embedded Systems
